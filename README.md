# Machine-Learning
A Tic Tac Toe AI project based on understanding the fundamentals of machine learning in Java.

Run the Main Class to begin the Tic Tac Toe simulation against an AI.
This project was compiled in the NetBeans compiler and uses its console to illustrate how the AI makes its moves.
To excute commands for the simulator, type in the console when it's your turn and it will print out the new board state.

Comments and criticism welcome!
